This project provides a comprehensive analysis of vendor performance to optimize profitability, enhance inventory management, and make informed purchasing decisions within a retail or wholesale environment. By integrating data from various sourcesâ€”purchases, sales, pricing, and freight costsâ€”we identify key performance indicators, uncover actionable insights, and deliver strategic recommendations for better vendor management.
